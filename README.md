# Idavoll Network Open Grants Program

Idavoll Network is a fully open sourced Polkadot Ecosystem project. In order to promote the construction of Idavoll Network's autonomous community under the concept of decentralization, the Idavoll Network Council launched the Open Grant program, which encourages developers who contribute to the community through the Grant program.

The Grant plan is mainly divided into two categories: development and community building. In the early tokens community, members of the tokens community made great contributions to the spread and development of tokens. Today's tokens cannot be separated from the early beliefs. The sermons of the readers, as Idavoll Network grows, we hope that more community users can participate and continue to inject vitality.

As a DAO Platform, Idavoll Network assumes the role of interconnecting all users to provide governance. IDV, Idavoll Network’s native token, is currently working hard to build an ecological portal tp link Polkadot Ecosystem projects together.

Idavoll Network is one of the first DAO Platform based on Polkadot's Substrate development framework. In project development, we value developers as the most important role in the establishment of our infrastructure. We will introduce in detail of the four development directions that are currently funded by the Idavoll Network Open Grant program.

1. Idavoll Wallet

Idavoll Wallet supports desktop and web. The web uses a browser plug-in or Signer as an integrated wallet. It will be compatible for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Provide users with instant and secure web and desktop encryption currency storage and transaction services.

Idavoll Wallet App is currently provided by the community. Some users use Math Wallet to import accounts and manage assets. If you have plans to develop an Idavoll Network Wallet App or mobile Signer for community users, that’s great. Apply for Grant as soon as possible!

2. Smart Contract

The Idavoll Smart Contract uses Substrate's Wasm contract module, and changes and tailors it based on it, adding some functions. Substrate's contract module designed a rent storage lease model, but this model has many difficulties to use and is very unfriendly to users. We removed it. For the rest, we changed some of the bottom layer of Substrate to make it compatible with the Substrate contract module on the Idavoll Network chain.

The DAO Platform based on Idavoll Network has many advantages, including high-latitude decentralization, low-cost and the use of a more secure contract language, so it has advantages that other tokens auxiliary projects of the same type do not have.

The birth of the Idavoll Network smart contract platform makes tokens more intelligent and will better display the value attributes of tokens. You can design any governance DApp on the Idavoll Network smart contract platform!

3. DeFi Product

The most important vision of DeFi is to certify all assets and eventually form an open financial system without borders in the world. The birth of tokens smart contracts further expands the asset attributes of tokens and enables it to generate new value anchors, resulting in more and more prosperous business models. We hope that based on the IDV smart contract, IDV's Defi can be born, which will greatly prosper the Defi ecosystem, and look forward to you bringing new qualitative changes to the Defi protocol!

4. Idavoll Court

Proposal agreement disputes rely on the decentralized oracle agreement, which is called the court, and the jury members own the IDV of Idavoll Network's own chain assets to win the right to perform dispute resolution services and receive a portion of the dispute resolution fee.

Idavoll Network is based on Substrate technology, comes with an innovation fund in the blockchain 3.0 era and has strong support for light nodes and runtime computing. Therefore, Idavoll Network is naturally friendly to DAO Platform. Idavoll Network has unified the transformation of inter-chain assets in a decentralized manner. As long as any chain establishes a link with Idavoll Network, it can communicate with all chains. So, we need your help to combine all the components together and develop a full governance Court to deal with binary disputes.
